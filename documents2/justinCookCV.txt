RELEVANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Led transformation efforts for a global software provider as an executive, successfully improving underperforming staff, and revolutionizing technical debt. Implemented measures including deprecating components, upgrading configuration management, and implementing redundancy, resulting in $1,000,000 in annual savings, improved reliability, and increased programmatic consumption for subscribers and the front office.

Successfully designed and led the transformation of a cloud-native IaaS to Kubernetes for global energy providers. I refreshed infrastructure as code, CI/CD, backup, monitoring, configuration, and capacity and identity management.

As an early adopter of Kubernetes, delivered Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on OpenStack and Azure for major UK government departments, passing audits and testing for OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE environments.

Designed and implemented complex orchestration software for middle office personnel to manage virtualized compute, NetApp, and Oracle RAC installations in a high-volume trading environment, prior to public cloud.

EXPERIENCE

PROPERTYME, Sydney, AU • Jun 2023-
We ease the burden of managing dozens of properties and occupying tenants. Our software gives property managers more time to focus on adding value and enjoying life – things that matter. Engineers at PropertyMe develop and operate our software. And we are key contributors to the features and products that enable the company’s vision.

Site Reliability Engineering Lead
I am a senior engineering lead facilitating SRE principles in the business. I am responsible for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems and infrastructure that deliver PropertyMe’s software.

Accomplishments
• The company used SRE in name only. I developed a strategy and content, prepared key stakeholders, trained engineers, and interfaced with product owners. I am responsible for the entirety of the company’s journey implementing site reliability engineering.
• Implementing SRE across engineering teams requires auditable temporary access to production resources. I augmented AWS identity centre and AWS Organizations and implementing instrumentation for web-based, on-demand and API access to cloud resources logged to AWS CloudTrail.
• Recent notable exploits require focus on protecting customers from phishing and email scams. Major providers such as Google and Yahoo have substantial updates to authentication and spam prevention requirements. I prepared the strategy and worked with marketing and operations to manage disruption of thousands of technology integrators. I implemented strong SPF, DKIM, and DMARC policies rejecting email that failed authentication and protected millions of users’ messages traversing PropertyMe platforms.
• The main data store was MySQL 5.7. It is no longer supported and soon to require extended support from AWS. I worked with engineering to ensure dozens of tables with several Petabytes of storage would migrate to MySQL 8 addressing concerns such as foreign key constraints, character set, and collation. I designed a blue/green deployment strategy that delivered a major upgrade with minimal downtime.
• The company’s application and platforms constantly receive malicious traffic both of foreign and competitor origin. I worked with product engineering and Cloudflare to onboard PropertyMe platforms to their CDN and WAF technology implemented and maintained entirely in code.
• After ten years, the company’s infrastructure as code was aged and spread across a complex and disjointed array of tools. I developed a next-generation infrastructure as code solution using provider’s remote APIs, Python API bindings, and implemented GitOps patterns that implement and maintain the lifecycle of AWS and Cloudflare assets.

INTERNATIONAL MOVE, London, UK-Sydney, AU • Nov 2022-Jun 2023
