# Agentic RAG

ðŸš§ Project Under Construction ðŸš§

## Overview

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a project designed to enhance the capabilities of natural language processing by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models. This project allows users to index documents, perform searches, and synthesize answers based on retrieved information.

## Features

- **Document Indexing**: Index text documents for efficient retrieval.
- **Search Functionality**: Perform searches on indexed documents using natural language queries.
- **Answer Synthesis**: Generate answers based on retrieved documents.
- **Grounding Verification**: Verify the grounding of generated answers against the source documents.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-rag.git
$ cd agentic-rag
agentic-rag$ pip install -r requirements.txt
...
```

The dependencies required are Ollama and mcphost:

```bash
