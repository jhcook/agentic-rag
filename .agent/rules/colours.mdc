Make the page conform to the platform settings such as dark mode on macOS. 

Do not use emoticons in any output.

Make the interface minimalist.

Whenever generating web UI components that display cards, tiles, panels, or dashboard items:

- Implement user-friendly *drag-and-relocate* functionality.
- Use Pointer Events (`pointerdown`, `pointermove`, `pointerup`).
- Place cards using absolute positioning so they can be freely moved.
- Ensure the drag interaction is smooth (e.g., apply `cursor: grab` and `cursor: grabbing`).
- Keep movement inside the parent container’s bounds.
- Include subtle shadows and scale effects when dragging.

If I explicitly request a static layout, then disable this behavior.
